# GREET BOT

## Problem Statement

### Stage 1:

The problem statement is to develop a robot that can recognize the face of a person and greet him/her in real-time. If the robot sees a person for the first time, then it should memorize the face and name of that person. Also, the robot should give directions to certain locations when asked.


### Stage 2: (On further funds from DRIE)

To implement the code on ROS, to enable continuous movement in the Robot with better accuracy, A 3D map of BIT mesra is to be implemented with a local guide kind of feature.
